# Predicting the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins using a Random Forest classifier
Protein function prediction is crucial to the proteomics field due to the increasing number of preotein sequences available and the costly exerimental process needed determine their function. However, function prediction is a highly complex problem and some simplifications such as subcellular location prediction can help orienting further research. The usage of machine learning methods has been applied in bioinformatics and computational biology with success in areas such as genomic analysis or protein structure prediction.
In this project we present a Random Forest classifier which is an effective algorithm for predicting subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins. After implementing a 5-fold cross validation to asses performance of the model we are get a 65.5\% accuracy.

As part of the Bioinformatics module during my MSc in Machine Learning.
